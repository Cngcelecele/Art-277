   <h4> Travelling in Depression</h4>

   <p>
     When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought <br>
     me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has <br>
     given me a unique learning experience.

      At five, I  <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" class="marveled" title="To make the brain suffer">marveled</a>  at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood   in the <br>
      heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways <br>
      on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and <br>

      walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the <br>
      thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in <br>

      It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first <br>
      became interested in language.
   </p>
   <p>
     It began with French, which taught me the importance of <br>
     pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris <br>
     where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it <br>
     PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on <br>
     the A, she looked at me bewildered.

     In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and <br>
     aware of its similarities with English through cognates. <br>
     Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks  <br>
     different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to <br> 
     me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates <br>
     come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.

     Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my <br>
     school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I <br>

     loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning <br>
     fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means <br>
     volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty <br>
     and rhythm as I form them.
