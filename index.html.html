      <p class="name">Dear Mr. Momo,</p>
      <p>Thanks you for your means application to join us at the Starz Universitys science family to study<br> as part of your <abr>PHD</abr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following section. </p>
      <h4>Starting dates</h4>
      <p>We are happy to accommodate you staring your study with us at any time, however it would suit<br> us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as<br> </p>
    <p>First semester: 9 October 2022<br> 
      Second semester: 15 January 2023 <br>
      Third semester: 2 may 2023 
      </p>
	 <p class="fifth paragraph">Please let me know if this is ok, and if so with start date you would prefer </p>
	  <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website. </p>
	  <h4>Subjects of study </h4>
	  <p>At the start university, we have a pretty open-minded research family—as long as the subject<br> fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seen like an intelligent, dedicate<br> researcher, and just the kind of person we’d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas<br> you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order priority. </p>
	  <p>Turing H2<sup>O</sup> into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
		<br>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass player at temperature exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C (86<sup>0</sup>F),<br> when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3x10,<sup>4</sup>,)
		</p>
	<p class="sixth paragraph">HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>
		<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you’d<br> expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we’d<br> need to know? Thanks </p>
		<h4>Exotic dance moves </h4>
		<p>Yes, you are right as part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To<br> answer your question my favorite’s dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
<dd>little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. A whole village<br> would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be “fruitful”
</dd><br />
<dt>Icelandic Brownian shuffle<dt>
		<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a mean of getting warm, they use to practice<br> this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling<br> their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny very rapid movements. One of my fellow<br> students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as tweaking. 
		</dd><br />
<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explores in the 1960s<br> believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by “robotic”, stilted<br> movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on<br> however it was discovered that that they were just moving like this because they were really<br> cold. 
</dd>
