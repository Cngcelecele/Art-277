    <h4><b>Travelling in Depression</b></h4>
    <p >When i was very little, i caught travel bug. it started after my grandparents first brought <br /> me to their home in France and 
    i have now been twenty-nine different countries. Each has<br /> given me a unique learning experience. </p>
    <p text-align="justify">At five, i <a href="http://www.starzit.com/">marveled<a/> at the Effel Tower in the city of lights. When i was eight., i stood in the <br /> heart of piazza San. Marco feeding horders of pigeons, then glided down venetian waterways<br /> on sleek gondolas. 
    At thirteen, i saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and<br /> <a href="#ch2"><img src="girl.jpg.png"style="width: 190px; height: 280px; padding: 3px; float: left;" ></a>  Walked along the Great Wall
    of China, amazed that the<br /> thousand-years stones were still in place just as it is in <br /> 
    <a href="http://www.starzit.com/">Starz University</a></p>
    <div style=" justify-content: center; text-align: justify;">
    <p>it was through exploring cultures around the world that i first<br /> became interested in language.</p>
    <p id="#ch2">It began with French, which taught me the importance of<br />
        pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris<br />
        where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it<br />
        PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on<br />
        the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p></div>
		<p> In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and<br />
aware of its similarities with English through cognates.<br />
Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks <br />
different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to <br />
me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates <br />
come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.<a href="mailto:cngcelecele11@gmail.com">Send us Email<a/></p>
<p> Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my
school,<br /> I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I

loved how long <br /> words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning<br />
fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means<br />
volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty<br /> and rhythm as i form them.</p>
